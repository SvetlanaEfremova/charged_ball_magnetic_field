The program determines the magnitude and draws the field lines of the magnetic field of a charged rotating ball (which, in particular, is the Earth).

Parameters, such as ball radius, charge, rotation speed, are set by user. The electric charge of the ball can be put to be distributed over the volume of the ball. Otherwise, it is assumed that the charge is distributed over its surface.

To display the value of magnetic induction at any point in space, you need to specify the coordinates x, y, z and click "display". The program can plot the dependences of x and z projections of magnetic flux density on the corresponding coordinates (Bx(x) and Bz(z)), as well as the dependence of Bz on Bx. In the latter case, the program, in fact, builds a picture of the magnetic field lines.
The plotted graphs can also be saved as png files.

The program interface is developed on Windows Forms, the logic is implemented in C++. 

The project was implemented in 2016 and may not work on new versions of Visual Studio. In this regard, the .exe file is also added to the project.
